**Welcome message from the author**

Hi, thank you for visiting this repository. I created it to compile my own "cookbook" for JavaScript. This repository primarily focuses on demonstrating the various JavaScript syntaxes. Additionally, I plan to include some toy projects and my JavaScript TILs (Today I Learned).

Any feedback or comments are sincerely appreciated.

**How the codes are written**

Most of the code in this repository is written in `html` files to demonstrate all the syntaxes using `VanillaJS` only, allowing for quick testing in a browser. Please consider this repository as a comprehensive guide or "masterbook" for VanillaJS.
